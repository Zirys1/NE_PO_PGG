# NE_PO_PGG

A Shiny app that alllows you to input the choice menu options of contributions to private and public fund, 
the number of participants per group, and the number of subjects receiving the payments in a public goods setting.
It outputs a graph showing the options and calculating the Pareto Optimum and Nash Equilibirum.

Not final version. Still needs to be verified that everything works correctly.
